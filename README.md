# Instructions

1. Clone the project
2. Install the dependencies, with any package manager you prefer (I use pnpm)
3. Run the project with `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`, and navigate to http://localhost:5000/api-docs/v1. You should see Swagger running (no specs defined).
4. Build the app with `pnpm build` or `npm run build` or `yarn build`, and run the app with `pnpm start` or `npm start` or `yarn start`. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/api-docs/v1. You will see the errors when trying to load the UI.
